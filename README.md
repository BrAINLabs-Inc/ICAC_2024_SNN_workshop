# Exploring Spiking Neural Networks

This repo was created to contain material used for [ICAC 2024](https://icac.lk/) (6th International Conference on Advancements in Computing) pre-conference workshop on [Exploring Spiking Neural Networks](https://icac.lk/preconference-workshops/).

Our workshop is divided into 3 parts (atm - modify as needed)

 1. **Session 1:** Introduction to spiking neural networks.
 2. **Session 2:** Differences between SNNs and ANNs.
 3. **Session 3:** SNN Applications for real-world problems.

**Note:** The notebooks are designed to run standalone, so they contain all the necessary  installation setup. We highly suggest to run these notebooks in Google colab.

## Contents

| Session | Slides | Colab
| --- | ---  | --- |
| Session 1 | [SNN vs ANN on MNIST Dataset](add any ppts / notes to github and paste that github link here - within brackets )|   ----- 
| Session 2 | [Tutorial 1: Modify this later() |[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](add the jupyter notebook to github and add the link here)
| Session 3 | Tutorial 2: Modify this later| [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](add the jupyter notebbok link here the same way)
