# Exploring Spiking Neural Networks

This repository contains material used for [ICAC 2024](https://icac.lk/) (6th International Conference on Advancements in Computing) pre-conference workshop on [Exploring Spiking Neural Networks](https://icac.lk/preconference-workshops/).

This workshop is divided into 3 parts 

 1. **Session 1:** Introduction to spiking neural networks (SNN).
 2. **Session 2:** Learnning in SNN.
 3. **Session 3:** SNN Applications for real-world problems.
